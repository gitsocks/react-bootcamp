# Phase 1: Basic Methods

> ðŸ’¡ Most of the concepts, terms and teachings are language agnostic, however, some things might be specific to JavaScript/TypeScript.

This phase focuses on all of the basics. Including things like basic functions, variables and types.

You will find a series of tests within the `test` folder. Each test will be structured as follows:

```ts
import { someFunction } from 'path/to/function'

describe('what the test case is about', () => {
    it('specific test', () => { ... })
})
```

Read the tests carefully to figure out what code you must right. 

You are not allowed, under any circumstances to change the test itself.

Good luck!
