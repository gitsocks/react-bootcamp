# Phase 1: Basic Methods

## Overview

> ðŸ’¡ Most of the concepts, terms and teachings are language agnostic, however, some things might be specific to JavaScript/TypeScript.

This phase focuses on all of the basics. Including things like basic functions, variables and types.

You will find a series of tests within the `test` folder. Each test will be structured as follows:

```ts
import { someFunction } from 'path/to/function'

describe('what the test case is about', () => {
    it('specific test', () => { ... })
})
```

## Kick Off

Each test case tries to tackle a specific topic with TypeScript and JavaScript. Make sure to read through the following
documents before tackling the relevant test cases.

### Functions
1. [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions).
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html).

### Objects
1. [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object).
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html).

### Modules
1. [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/modules.html).

An integral part of building any app is authentication & account management. The first couple of phases will focus on getting that set up.

Read the tests carefully to figure out what code you must right. 

You are not allowed, under any circumstances to change the test itself.

Good luck!
