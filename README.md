# React & TypeScript Bootcamp

The goal of this repo is to help you improve & test your programming skills. Using unit tests, you will have to write code that ensure that the tests pass. This project relies on the honesty system, meaning, nothing stops you from just updating the tests, but that would of course hinder your progress. 

## How does it work?

The idea is simple. Each branch has a series of unit tests written using `vitest` and `@testing-library/react`. For each phase of this bootcamp, you can branch off of the original phase branch and write code that will let the tests pass. Once you have the tests passing, you can move on to the next phase. Each phase will have an `INTRODUCTION.md` file which will explain the phase in more detail. 

## Getting started

To get started, fork this repo. Each phase is represented by its own branch. It is recommended to tackle the phases in chronological order. 

To tackle a new phase, create a new branch off of the phase branch. It is important to call this prefix this branch with `solution/...`. After creating the new branch, run `npm run test` to run the tests for the phase. The tests will fail by default.

You are now ready to start writing the code until the tests pass. Once you have 100% of the tests passing, you have completed the phase and can move on to the next phase.
